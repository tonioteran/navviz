# Navigation Vi[z]ualization Library

Based on OpenGL, navviz is designed as a fully customizable C++ 3D visualization tool.

The idea is to be able to support visualization of poses, frames, transformations,
point clouds, and everything and anything that you'd like. I want to allow the use of
libraries such as:
- Eigen
- PCL
- OpenCV
- ...
- you name it!
